description: Analyzing anomalies to detect HTTP DDoS attacks using machine learning models.
---

My latest publication in 2024 focuses on a crucial cybersecurity challenge: **HTTP DDoS** attacks.

In this research, I explored the use of **Machine Learning** models to detect anomalies in HTTP traffic. This approach allows security systems to identify attack patterns that often escape detection based on traditional rules.

### Key Takeaways:
- Implementation of advanced machine learning methodologies for detection accuracy.
- Real-time traffic pattern analysis for rapid mitigation.
- Contribution towards a more resilient digital infrastructure security.
