Finally, this blog is live! 😄

Hi everyone, I'm **Nusantara**. I created this space to share my experiences while tinkering with servers, building automations, or simply documenting the cloud certifications I've been working on.

Moving forward, I'll be sharing interesting news and trends from the **DevOps** and **CI/CD** world to keep us all in the loop. So, feel free to drop by whenever you can!

Check out the [About Me](/about/) page to see my full CV and the certifications I've earned. Cheers! 🍻
