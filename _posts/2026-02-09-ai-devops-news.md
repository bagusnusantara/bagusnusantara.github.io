The DevOps world is buzzing! In 2024 and 2025, the integration of AI within **CI/CD** pipelines has skyrocketed. 🤖

We once thought AI was primarily for generating text or images, but now it's actively helping us:
- **Auto-scan for security vulnerabilities** before code even hits deployment.
- **Predict system failures** through smarter monitoring (*AIOps*).
- Even **generate IaC scripts** like Terraform or Ansible on the fly!

Reports suggest that around 76% of DevOps teams globally are experimenting with AI to automate mundane tasks. If you haven't started exploring AI in your workflow yet, it's definitely time to hop on board!
