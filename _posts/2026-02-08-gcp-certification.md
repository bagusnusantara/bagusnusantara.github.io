Happy to announce another certification milestone in 2025! 🎉

To be honest, the **Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer** exam was tougher than I expected. It tests a lot of real-world scenarios, ranging from IAM policies to complex VPC networking configurations.

After months of studying and hands-on experience at DPTSI ITS, I finally cleared it. For me, this certification is more than just a credential—it's solid proof of my ability to navigate and manage Google's cloud ecosystem effectively.

What should I aim for next? Feel free to drop some suggestions on LinkedIn! 😉
